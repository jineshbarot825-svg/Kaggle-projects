    "### **1. Your New Assistant: The \"Kaggle-Concierge\" Pitch**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** Data scientists on Kaggle spend a lot of time on repetitive \"setup\" tasks for every new project: creating folder structures (`/data`, `/notebooks`, `/submission`), downloading datasets, and keeping track of which projects are in which stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** \"The 'Kaggle-Concierge'\" is a personal AI assistant swarm. The data scientist (user) gives a (mocked) high-level command like `\"start new project: 'Titanic'\"` or `\"download dataset: 'House Prices'\"` to a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The swarm activates:\n",
    "1.  A **Sequential** `PlannerAgent` picks up the new command.\n",
    "2.  A **Parallel Team** of specialist agents (`FolderAgent`, `DatasetAgent`) execute the setup tasks *at the same time*.\n",
    "3.  The agents use **Mocked Tools** (`tool_create_folders`, `tool_download_dataset`) to simulate these actions.\n",
    "4.  An **Evaluation Agent** (the `DashboardAgent`) acts as the \"brain.\" It reads reports from the specialists and **generates** a new status update.\n",
    "5.  This \"brain\" agent then uses a **Real Custom Tool** (`tool_update_dashboard`) to **write** the new project's status to a `PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md` file.\n",
    "6.  This `PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md` file acts as the **Stateful Long-Term Memory**, which the agent reads from and writes to, keeping a permanent log of all projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project creates a \"personal assistant\" that automates the tedious parts of data science, letting the user focus on building models."

    "### **2. The Assistant's Skills**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a capstone project that demonstrates all 6 key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Multi-agent System:**\n",
    "    * **Sequential Agents:** `PlannerAgent` -> (Parallel Team) -> `DashboardAgent` (the \"Brain\").\n",
    "    * **Parallel Agents:** `FolderAgent` and `DatasetAgent` run at the same time to set up the project faster.\n",
    "    * **Loop Agent:** The main `run_concierge_swarm` function acts as a \"daemon\" loop, processing a queue of user commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Tools:**\n",
    "    * **Mocked Built-in Tool:** `tool_create_folders` simulates creating a directory structure.\n",
    "    * **Mocked Built-in Tool:** `tool_download_dataset` simulates downloading a `.csv` file from Kaggle.\n",
    "    * **Real Custom Tool:** `tool_update_dashboard` saves the final, formatted project status to a `PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Long-Running Operations (Pause/Resume):**\n",
    "    * The main swarm function is a **Loop** that processes the `command_queue` and then \"pauses\" (`time.sleep`) to wait for new user commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Long-Term Memory (Stateful & File-Based):**\n",
    "    * This project uses the file system itself as its Long-Term Memory.\n",
    "    * **Stateful Read/Write:** The `DashboardAgent` **reads** the `MEMORY_BANK` (a Python dict) for the current state, and then uses its **Real Custom Tool** to **write** the *new* state to the `PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md` file, creating a persistent, stateful log.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Agent Evaluation (The \"Brain\"):**\n",
    "    * The `DashboardAgent` is the \"brain.\" It reads and evaluates the reports from the parallel agents (`{\"status\": \"folders_created\"}`), *synthesizes* them into a new project status, and *generates* a new Markdown-formatted string for the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Observability:**\n",
    "    * A `log_message()` function provides a rich, real-time log of every agent's actions and decisions."
