    "### **1. 🚀 The Pitch (Enterprise Agents Track)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** E-commerce businesses lose billions annually to fraudulent transactions. Manually reviewing every order is impossible, but simplistic automated systems often block legitimate customers (false positives) or miss sophisticated fraud (false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** \"Transaction-Shield\" is an autonomous **enterprise agent swarm** that acts as a real-time fraud detection \"daemon.\" It monitors a (mocked) live stream of new orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new order is detected, the swarm activates:\n",
    "1.  A **Sequential** `MonitorAgent` logs the order.\n",
    "2.  A **Parallel Team** of specialist agents (`HistoryAgent`, `BillingAgent`, `VelocityAgent`) investigate the order simultaneously for different \"red flags.\"\n",
    "3.  The agents **Read from Long-Term Memory** to check against known fraud lists and order-velocity history.\n",
    "4.  The agents **Write to Long-Term Memory** to update the order-velocity history, making the swarm \"smarter\" with each transaction.\n",
    "5.  An **Evaluation Agent** (the `RiskManagerAgent`) acts as the \"brain.\" It reads all the technical reports, *calculates* a risk score, and *generates* a single, human-readable justification for its final decision: `APPROVE`, `REJECT`, or `FLAG FOR MANUAL REVIEW`.\n",
    "6.  A final agent uses a **Real Custom Tool** to write all \"flagged\" orders to a `MANUAL_REVIEW_QUEUE.md` file for the human fraud-review team.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project automates a high-stakes, real-world business workflow, saving the company money and protecting customer relationships.\n"

    "### **2. ⚙️ Features Demonstrated**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a capstone project that demonstrates all 6 key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Multi-agent System:**\n",
    "    * **Sequential Agents:** `MonitorAgent` -> (Parallel Team) -> `RiskManagerAgent` -> `PublisherAgent`.\n",
    "    * **Parallel Agents:** `HistoryAgent`, `BillingAgent`, and `VelocityAgent` all run at the same time.\n",
    "    * **Loop Agent:** The main `run_transaction_shield_swarm` function acts as a \"daemon\" loop, processing a queue of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Tools:**\n",
    "    * **Mocked Built-in Tool:** `tool_get_customer_history` is used by the `HistoryAgent` (simulates a database lookup).\n",
    "    * **Mocked Built-in Tool:** `tool_check_ip_location` is used by the `BillingAgent` (simulates an IP-to-location API).\n",
    "    * **Real Custom Tool:** `tool_flag_for_manual_review` saves the final, formatted alert to a `.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Long-Running Operations (Pause/Resume):**\n",
    "    * The main swarm function is a **Loop** that processes the order queue and then \"pauses\" (`time.sleep`) to wait for new transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Long-Term Memory:**\n",
    "    * **Write:** The `VelocityAgent` **writes** timestamps to `MEMORY_BANK[\"order_timestamps_by_ip\"]` *after every order*.\n",
    "    * **Read:** The `VelocityAgent` **reads** this same list to detect high-velocity fraud. The `HistoryAgent` **reads** `MEMORY_BANK[\"known_fraud_users\"]`. This is a very advanced, stateful memory system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Agent Evaluation (The \"Brain\"):**\n",
    "    * The `RiskManagerAgent` is the \"brain.\" It reads and evaluates three different technical reports, *calculates* a `risk_score`, and *generates* a new, human-readable `justification` string for its final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Observability:**\n",
    "    * A `log_message()` function provides a rich, real-time log of every agent's actions and decisions.\n",
    "    * "

    "# **⭐ How It Works**\n",
    "# The \"Transaction-Shield\" swarm runs as a continuous, 24/7 \"daemon\" that processes new orders one by one. Here is the life cycle of a single transaction:\n",
    "1. 📥 Order Detected\n",
    "The main run_transaction_shield_swarm loop acts as a \"daemon,\" pulling a new order (a Python dictionary) from the (mocked) queue.\n",
    "The MonitorAgent (Sequential Agent 1) receives the order, logs it, and passes it to the specialist team.\n",
    "2. 🕵️ Parallel Investigation\n",
    "The swarm's key efficiency comes from its parallel design. The order is sent to three specialist agents at the exact same time:\n",
    "HistoryAgent: Checks the customer_id. It uses the tool_get_customer_history (mocked tool) to see if it's a new customer and Reads the MEMORY_BANK[\"known_fraud_users\"] list to check for a match.\n",
    "BillingAgent: Looks for location anomalies. It uses the tool_check_ip_location (mocked tool) and compares the IP's country to the billing and shipping countries.\n",
    "VelocityAgent: This is the stateful agent. It Reads the MEMORY_BANK[\"order_timestamps_by_ip\"] to count recent orders from the same IP. Then, it Writes the new order's timestamp back to this list, making the swarm \"smarter\" for the next loop.\n",
    "3. 🧠 The \"Brain\" Makes a Decision\n",
    "The RiskManagerAgent (The \"Brain\") waits for all three specialists to finish.\n",
    "It evaluates all the \"flags\" they've raised.\n",
    "It synthesizes these flags into a single risk_score and generates a human-readable justification string (e.g., \"Risk Score: 80. Flags: [IP/Billing mismatch; High-Velocity]\").\n",
    "It makes a final decision: APPROVE, REJECT, or FLAG_FOR_REVIEW.\n",
    "It also Writes this full decision to the MEMORY_BANK[\"decision_log\"] for auditing.\n",
    "4. 🔔 The Final Report\n",
    "If (and only if) the \"Brain's\" decision is FLAG_FOR_REVIEW or REJECT, the PublisherAgent is activated.\n",
    "It uses the Real Custom Tool (tool_flag_for_manual_review) to write the order_id and the \"Brain's\" justification into the MANUAL_REVIEW_QUEUE.md file.\n",
    "5. 🔄 Pause and Repeat\n",
    "The loop completes, time.sleep is called (to simulate pausing), and the MonitorAgent wakes up to check the queue for the next order."
